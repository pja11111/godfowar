        <p>
            An undercooked looter-shooter by every metric, Redfall’s chief problem is that it’s simply not ready to be played. By the halfway mark of 
            the story – when it shifts to the second of its two separate open-world maps – I was already thoroughly underwhelmed by the bland missions, 
            weak combat, and repeated technical problems I’d seen. Of course, I’d held out hope for the possibility that things would crescendo as it 
            approached its conclusion; that an imaginative finale might make jostling with all the jank worth a Game Pass glance for vampire junkies 
            and co-op crews. Unfortunately, it doesn’t get better. If anything, it gets worse – like the delayed reaction of a knock to the crotch.

        <h2>Elden Ring Wiki Guide</h2>
        <p>
            Redfall is a distinct departure from the likes of Deathloop and Dishonored. Certainly some of that Arkane DNA has sidestepped its way into
             the finished product – chiefly in the magical abilities of the four available powered-up protagonists – but Redfall’s open-world approach
              to a modern-day Massachusetts is otherwise a little more mundane in comparison. Not only does the architecture seem a little flavourless 
              compared to Deathloop’s funky retro-futurism and the Victorian backdrop of Dishonored, but also the whole thing is lacking in fidelity and 
              detail. This is not a showcase of what the Xbox Series X is capable of.
