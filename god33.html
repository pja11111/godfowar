        <h2>God of War Review</h2>
        <p>
          There’s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly 
          aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, 
          and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story 
          that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after I’d finished its main campaign 
          some 40 odd hours later.

        <h2>God of War Wiki Guide</h2>
        <p>
          God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot. Kratos and Atreus – who start as, at best, acquaintances – 
          begin their journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus bonded with much more than his father. The two set 
          out to the tallest point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.The setup is Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak 
          in the distance and knew I’d get there eventually – but as similar stories have taught me, the path is never a straight or easy one. A number 
          of obstacles, both natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth of terrifying threats, beginning with the first major 
          encounter in the opening hours.
