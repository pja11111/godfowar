        <h2>Hades Review</h2>
        <p>
            In the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, a poor soul is doomed to forever push a boulder uphill without rest. Each time he’d push it up, 
            it would roll back down again and he’d have to start anew. But what if that Herculean climb uphill was actually awesome combat against a 
            randomized variety of enemies as you fight your way out of Hell, with a wide range of godly powers that grow and combine in interesting 
            ways as you progress? And what if, instead of going back to zero, you got a little stronger each time with some help from a colorful cast 
            of allies and enemies who remember each of your attempts? That’s Hades’ premise, and the Greek mythology-themed rogue-lite that developer 
            Supergiant has built around it makes going to Hell a joy.

            Players control Zagreus, the son of Hades, as he attempts to escape from the Underworld to reach Mount Olympus, at times aided by gifts 
            bestowed on him from the other Olympians. Each run challenges the player through a random series of rooms populated with enemies and rewards
            The game has a hack and slash combat system; the player uses a combination of their main weapon attack, a special attack, a dash ability, and a magic ability to defeat
